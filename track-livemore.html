                <p class="body-primary-text">About LiveMore</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">LiveMore is a free self-development app providing content from experts worldwide to help people implement positive changes to their lives. We provide 3 types of content - namely Short Reads, Quizzes and Tracks. </p>
                
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">We were facing low completion rate for Tracks - which were guided exercises that take 20-30 minutes to be completed.</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">Based on our data from Mixpanel, we had a completed track rate of merely 1% in March 2020.</p>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Research & Testing</p>
                <p class="body-primary-text">Objectives</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">1. To better understand users‚Äô goals and motivations towards personal development</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">2. What are their needs and behaviors?</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">3. How are people using existing/competitors' product? What features are the most important to them?</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing4">4. To determine the current pain points in the process of doing tracks</p>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Key Findings</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">The research uncovered understanding of users‚Äô activities, areas of interest after work, as well as when and where they would usually do a self-development activity.</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing1">The feedback on tracks were categorised into:</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing1">‚Ä¢ Engagement (longer term/bigger picture considerations</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing1">‚Ä¢ Content</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing4">‚Ä¢ Interaction/design (which also includes bugs/coding improvements etc)</p>

                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing1">‚è∞ How might we explain the nature and duration of tracks?</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing4"><i>"Am I supposed to do this as a daily thing? Don‚Äôt know what should I do? Am I supposed to do this tomorrow? I feel a bit confused. I just tracked 1 day of sleep that‚Äôs all. I feel there is a need for follow up action"</i></p>

                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing1">üìù How might we encourage users to fill in track's input? </p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing6"><i>‚ÄúI will do the table but I won‚Äôt do it now. I will think about it and set a time to do it‚Äù</i></p>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Content - documented and shared with the team</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">The feedback related to Content were organised into a document, which was passed over to my colleague who worked closely with the experts. However, I realised these feedback weren't followed up closely by my colleague. It suggested that there was a need for me to advocate research and also communicate possible actionable suggestions to the existing content.</p>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Interaction and Design - make minimal changes to improve usability </p>
               <!-- Point 1 -->
                <p class="body-secondary-text case-study-point">Update: Reduce the need for users to tap on "Continue" repeatedly after each exercise. Append different exercises into 1 page, and the "Continue" button only appears after the user has completed 1 Action with several Exercises. A page progress indicator is also added so that the user has clear feedback on where his/her progress is at within the page. </p>

                    <div class="case-study-image">

                        <p class="image-subtitle spacing2">Previous Track page, where the Continue button was sticky</p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">Previously, the ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô button was sticky and it was frustrating for users who were trying to fill in their inputs. </p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing6"><i>"Perhaps my thumbs are placed wrongly on the screen but I tend to accidentally click on the ‚ÄòContinue‚Äô tab when actually I want to fill in the blanks."</i></p>

                <!-- Point 2 -->
                <p class="body-secondary-text case-study-point">Update: Redesign the Track Overview page, as the previous design appeared to be clickable (but it wasn't) and it did not clearly show all the actions within a Track</p>
                <div class="before-after">
                    <div class="case-study-image">

                </div>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing6"><i>"I thought that it is clickable but it isn‚Äôt"</i></p>

                <!-- Point 3 -->
                <p class="body-secondary-text case-study-point">Update page transitions: 1) Eliminate all "buggy/slow" transitions as much as possible 2) When user has scrolled down and tapped "Back", it should bring user back to the previous "scrolled down view", instead of having user to scroll down again</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2"> From overview page to Action 1, the shuffle made user thought that a part was skipped (page transition problem)</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing6"><i>"Clicking into a track, but when I click back I get brought to the whole list of tracks (from the top) again"</i></p>
            

                <!-- Point 4 -->
                <p class="body-secondary-text case-study-point spacing3">Add a default OS pop-up when action is completed. </p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing6"><i>"No cue to signal that the action is completed. The slight pop-up to show that a new action is available works, but it isn‚Äôt exciting and obvious enough."</i></p>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Design Handoff</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">I mapped out the entire screen flow and added explanations on the areas to work on in my Figma file. This enabled developers to read and understand the reason behind the design updates. </p>
                <img class="seventy-full-image" src="../img/Track Overview Page improvements.png"; alt="">
                <p class="image-subtitle spacing4">Snippet of the figma handoff</p>
                
                <p class="body-primary-text">Conclusion</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">2 months after the Tracks improvements were made, I was glad to see that the completion of tracks had improved. Of course, there were still many aspects we could work on within LiveMore Tracks.</p>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Challenges</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">Synthesising the research data into design decisions was the toughest challenge in this project. After grouping the responses based on "Categories", I had also organised them into the different parts of a user journey as shown below. Because there wasn't a Product Manager role back then, it felt hard to prioritise design decisions based on the organised research data.</p>
