                <p class="body-primary-text">Background</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">Joining a new company a couple of weeks before the product launch was an interesting personal experience to me, as most startups I have worked with already have launched their products in the market.
                    As such, I decided to pen down some of the improvements I proposed to the product, hoping that it would better prepare the product for its launch.</p>
                
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing4">There were prior feedback given by testers (not using user research methods but more of "solutioning-suggestions"), and I did not refer to these to propose any new product features before the launch. But when there were problems raised by testers, I tried to understand the story behind the problem they faced, and why the experience was poor on their end. I made slight improvements to these pages, as explained below. </p>
                
                <p class="body-primary-text">About LiveMore</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">LiveMore is a free self-development app providing content from experts worldwide to help people implement positive changes to their life. We provide 3 types of content - namely Short Reads, Quizzes and Tracks.</p>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Home Page</p>  
                     <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">After joining LiveMore, one of the most prominent problems pointed out was the Home Page. </p>
                     <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">As mentioned by several testers, the problems with existing home page design are:</p>
                     <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2 text-indent">   • New users "don’t know where to start" -> lack of clear entry point</p>
                     <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2 text-indent">   • Hard to find all the tracks (where they have to click on the Develop tab then "See All")</p>
                     <p class="body-secondary-text spacing4 text-indent">   • Lack of the LiveMore brand identity</p>
                    
                     <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">In order to solve the problem of missing clear entry point and poor accessibility of tracks, I designed the new home page to clearly state the 3 different types of content – Short Reads, Quizzes and Tracks.</p>
                     <p class="body-secondary-text spacing4">To also improve the sense of brand identity, I have added the LiveMore logo, colours and fonts accordingly. Since we were using a different UI framework for iOS and Android, I also tweaked certain design elements that were individually unique to iOS or Android, to elements that look common to both OS. </p>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Onboarding screens</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">Onboarding assists users in understanding what is LiveMore about, before they decide whether to sign up.</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">At this point, it felt like a good opportunity for us to consider our colour palette, and decide the colours for different UI elements such as the primary and secondary buttons, hyperlinks etc. Prior to thi we had been using the default OS colours and elements. Working with orange and turqoise blue was challenging as it was tough to find darker shades of these colours which actually look good on mobile interfaces.</p>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Quiz results page</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">As mentioned by several users, some problems with the previous quiz result page were</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing1 text-indent">• What does the absolute score mean? How does it help me to understand myself better?</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing4 text-indent">• They didn’t see the recommended tracks below</p>
                
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2">As such, the new page design aims to improve the experience by:</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2 text-indent">• Showing the maximum score of the quiz (The team previously discussed to recalibrate all maximum scores to 100, but since not all the maximum scores of Quizzes are 100, this means that we have to recalculate all the ranges of scores experts have provided us – which is very time consuming)</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2 text-indent">• Have a short description of ‘who you are’ – “You are moderately active” etc. to clearly and concisely explain to the users what their results mean</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2 text-indent">• Show the score range which users falls in</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing2 text-indent">• Add "Recommended tracks"/ "What might interest you"</p>

                <div class="before-after">
                    <div class="case-study-image">
                        <img src="../img/quiz results (old screen).png" alt="Previous Quiz Results page">
                        <p class="image-subtitle spacing2">Previous Quiz Results page</p>

                </div>

                <p class="body-primary-text">Conclusion</p>
                <p class="body-secondary-text spacing4">These were some of the more significant improvements I did for LiveMore 1+ months before our product launch. Since we were a new company, there were a lot of exploratory approaches taken to understand what our target audience prefer and how could we engage them better.
